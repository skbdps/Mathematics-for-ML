<div class="about-content">

I am **Suryansh Kumar**, a data engineer at HDFC Bank with a Major in MSE from IIT Gandhinagar (CSE minor). I work as a Data Engineer building pipelines that move and process terabytes to petabytes of financial data; CDC streams, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, the works.

So why this blog?

Well, I am starting this as just a hobby project. The transition from "moving data" to "learning from data" felt less like a career pivot and more like a natural extension.

I'm writing these posts as I study to solidify my own understanding. While studying, I felt that the textual resources I found were either too dry and complicated (textbooks) or too hand-wavy (most blog posts). I wanted something in between: **rigorous enough to be correct, but written in a way that builds genuine intuition.**. I would be really glad if this help out someone in any way.

I have tried to include all references. I have used AI tools for summaries, titles, rephrasing sentences, and formatting mathematical equations in KaTeX. However, the underlying notes, explanations, and explanation style are my own.

## The Series

Every post in the "Math for ML" series builds on the previous one:

1. **Linear Algebra** — vectors, transformations, eigenvalues, PCA
2. **Multivariate Calculus** — Jacobians, gradients, Taylor series, gradient descent
3. **Building a simple Neural Network from Scratch** — *(coming soon)*
4. **Probability & Statistics** — *(coming soon)*
5. **Information Theory** - *(coming soon)*

The goal is to go from mathematical foundations to training/fine tuning an LLM from scratch and understand what we are actually doing instead of just using a pre-built code based guide.
